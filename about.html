  <h2 class="title">About 42nd & Empire</h2>
  <p>It all started with a single phrase from my husband's work "support hero."</p>

  <p>For years I'd dabbled in sewing, and most around the time I heard about
  the support hero position at New Relic, I had made a fun, sparkly cape for my
  daughter. So I asked my husband if he thought maybe the support hero at work
  should have a cape. He loved the idea, so I whipped out an adult length cape
  with a hand-stitched Ruby logo that you can see on the home page.</p>

  <p>It was a huge hit. The cape was frequently worn around the office, and my
  husband even gave a talk at his local users group, and then
  <a href="http://confreaks.com/videos/3327-railsconf-make-an-event-of-it">at
  RailsConf 2014</a>, wearing the majestic Ruby cape.</p>

  <p>The cape was so popular in fact that people kept asking here they could
  get them. 42nd & Empire is the result of that question. I'm here for all your
  nerdy custom sewing needs, but our hearts are in capes and things that make
  the workplace just a little more... sparkly.</p>
