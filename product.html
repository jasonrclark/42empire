  <ul>
    <li>Capes are custom, so your design is <i>yours</i></li>
    <li>You can be as involved in the design process as you want! Anywhere from
    "Just make something cool," to getting in the thick of material and color
    choices.</li>
    <li>Typical design includes:
      <ul style="margin-top:10px">
        <li>Colored satin lining</li>
        <li>Sparkly exterior fabric</li>
        <li>Hand-embroidered felt badge</li>
        <li>Soft cotton webbing strap</li>
        <li>Reflective snap buckle</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
