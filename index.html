  <h2 class="title">Who is Your Hero?</h2>
  <p>Your team is awesome, but sometimes someone goes above and beyond. Maybe
  he gave that customer support case the extra push for a speedy resolution.
  Maybe she solved those gnarly performance bugs plauging your
  system. Sometimes your teammates are more than coworkers; they're heroes.</p>

  <p>And a hero needs a cape.</p>

  <p>Here at 42nd & Empire, we're dedicated to providing the custom capes and
  other hand-sewn items that bring recognition and fun in a single stroke.
  Whether it's a language emblem, your company logo, or an internal slogan, we
  can make the cape to keep your team looking heroic.</p>

  <h3 class="title">Enough Chit-Chat, What Do They Look Like?</h3>
